Hey there! I'm Med, just a regular guy who enjoys coding and building stuff.

My coding adventure began at 13 when I started messing with Counter-Strike game configs to save time. Then, inspired by a friend making cool game maps for Warcraft Frozen Throne, I thought, 'Why not give it a shot?' That's when I created my first Warcraft map at 14.

Fast forward to high school, a YouTube tutorial on HTML and CSS caught my eye. I gave it a go, copied some code, and bam! I had my own website, even if the templates were a horrible but i like it.

High school ended, and it was time to pick a major. As a tech fan, I went for Computer Science. Over three years, I learned a bit of everything – web development, mobile, networks, AI, you name it. But building websites was always my thing.

I decided to dive deeper and did a master's in software engineering. Along the way, I built some full-stack applications. Now, I'm a full-stack developer, and recently, I've been exploring the 3D world with Three.js. And that's my story – just a guy who found joy in coding and never stopped building cool things!"
